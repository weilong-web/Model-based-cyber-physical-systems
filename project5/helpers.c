    FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used

    to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
    specified, or call vTaskDelay()).  If the application makes use of the
    vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
    important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling
    function, because it is the responsibility of the idle task to clean up
